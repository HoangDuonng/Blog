DevOps helps development and operations teams work together more effectively through tools, automated processes, and collaborative culture.\nWhy is DevOps Important? Accelerated Development Speed DevOps helps automate processes like testing, deployment, and monitoring, reducing time-to-market for products.\nImproved Product Quality Integration of automated testing and CI/CD helps detect bugs early, minimizing risks during software deployment.\nEnhanced Reliability Monitoring and logging tools help quickly identify issues, reduce downtime, and ensure systems operate stably.\nBetter Team Collaboration DevOps breaks down barriers between development and operations teams, creating a more effective collaborative work environment.\nKey Components of DevOps CI/CD (Continuous Integration \u0026amp; Continuous Deployment) CI/CD automates the process of source code integration, testing, and deployment, minimizing errors when releasing products to production environments.\nInfrastructure as Code (IaC) IaC allows infrastructure management as code, making it easy to deploy and scale systems.\nMonitoring and Logging Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack help monitor and analyze logs to quickly handle incidents.\nContainerization and Orchestration Docker and Kubernetes help package, manage, and scale applications flexibly.\nPopular DevOps Tools CI/CD: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD IaC: Terraform, Ansible, CloudFormation Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack Container \u0026amp; Orchestration: Docker, Kubernetes Source Code Management: Git, GitHub, GitLab Conclusion DevOps is an important methodology that helps improve development speed, product quality, and optimize system operations. In the upcoming articles of this series, we will explore each aspect of DevOps in depth, from CI/CD, Infrastructure as Code to system monitoring.\nDocker Example 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 # Use Node.js as the base FROM node:18 # Set working directory in container WORKDIR /app # Copy package.json and install dependencies COPY package.json .
