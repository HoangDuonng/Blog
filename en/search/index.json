[{"content":"🌐 Why point a domain to hosting? Domain and hosting are the two essentials that keep a website online.\nDomain is the website address. Hosting stores the website data. Why you need to point a domain Connect the domain to hosting so the site appears on the internet. Let people access the site using a memorable address. How it works 🔧 Get nameserver or IP information from your hosting provider. Configure it in your domain management dashboard. Three simplest ways to point a domain to hosting 🚀 Point using nameservers Steps:\nLog in to your domain management panel. Select the domain you want to point. Select the domain to point to hosting\nReplace the default nameservers with the hosting provider\u0026rsquo;s nameservers (found in the hosting welcome email). Replace default nameservers with your hosting nameservers\nWait for DNS propagation (minutes to hours, up to 24h). Verify by visiting the domain. Point using IP (A record) Steps:\nLog in to your domain management panel. Select the domain and open DNS settings\nOpen the DNS settings. Add two A records: @ → Hosting IP (from the provider email). www → Hosting IP. Add two A records\nSave changes and wait for DNS propagation (minutes to hours). Point using an intermediate nameserver To point a domain via an intermediate nameserver such as Cloudflare, Namecheap FreeDNS, or Incapsula, follow these steps:\nSteps:\nCreate an account with the intermediate nameserver and confirm required DNS records. In your domain registrar, change the nameservers to the intermediate provider. Wait for propagation. Common issues when pointing a domain to hosting ⚠️ You may run into issues that prevent your site from working correctly. Understanding these will help you troubleshoot faster.\n🚫 Wrong hosting domain When registering hosting, the provider asks for your domain. If it is incorrect or mismatched, the website may not work.\n🚫 Using both methods at once If you already pointed a domain via nameservers, do not switch to IP (A record) at the same time. It can cause DNS conflicts.\n🚫 Incorrect DNS record type Common DNS record types include:\nA record: Points the domain to the hosting IP. CNAME: Points one domain to another. MX record: Configures email. Entering the wrong record type can break connectivity.\n🚫 Wrong hosting IP Hosting IPs are long and easy to mistype. Copy directly from the provider email to avoid confusion with a personal IP.\nIf errors occur, double-check your settings and wait for DNS updates to finish.\nVideo guide 🎥 For a visual walkthrough, watch the video below. It covers steps from getting nameserver details to updating settings in your domain manager.\n― Source, F8 Official ✔️\nConclusion 🌟 Pointing a domain to hosting is essential for your website to work online. Whether you use nameservers, A records, or an intermediate nameserver, double-check your settings and allow time for DNS propagation. If you encounter issues, review the configuration and try again 🔄.

It is not just about transferring files but also ensuring everything runs smoothly and securely. This guide walks you through the steps, from preparing files and databases to using the right upload tools.\nKey points to remember Before you start uploading, keep these essentials in mind:\n✅ What to prepare before uploading: Website files, database, control panel access, and an FTP client like FileZilla.\n✅ Ways to upload: Choose a reliable host, then use File Manager, FTP, WordPress plugins, SSH, or provider support.\n✅ Why upload to hosting: Makes your site public, improves security, boosts speed, and simplifies management.\n✅ Four steps to upload a website:\nUpload website files to public_html via File Manager or FTP. Verify files are in the correct location. Create a database in cPanel, import via phpMyAdmin, and configure the connection. Visit the website to confirm everything works. What do you need before uploading a website? Prepare the following:\nWebsite files: These can be the contents of your old public_html folder, source code, or the latest backup. 📌 Note for React/Vue.js deployments\nWhen building a React or Vue.js app, you do not upload the full source code, only the static build output.\n🔹 Build and zip steps:\nRun the build command: React: 1 npm run build Vue.js: 1 npm run build The output folder is usually build/ (React) or dist/ (Vue.js). Zip the build or dist folder before uploading. 📤 Uploading to the server:\nWith cPanel, extract directly in public_html. With SSH/SFTP, upload and unzip using: 1 unzip build.zip -d /var/www/html/ Ensure your Apache/Nginx config points to the folder containing index.html. Database file (if applicable). Control panel access for the new hosting account. FTP client such as FileZilla. To upload, access your hosting control panel via an FTP client like FileZilla. If your site already exists, use the CMS or cPanel backup feature to download it and upload to the new host.\nChoose a reliable hosting provider Quality hosting affects both speed and long-term performance. Choose carefully based on:\nLive support: 24/7 customer support for quick issue resolution. Account control: Full access to cPanel or equivalent tools. Scalability: Ability to upgrade storage, bandwidth, or domains. Clear refund policy: Flexible refunds for testing services. Free add-ons: SSL, scheduled backups, or free migrations.

If you extracted a backup into a subfolder, users would need to visit example.com/something instead of example.com. Fix this by moving files:\nOpen the folder with the website files. Select all files, right-click, and choose Move. Select public_html and click Proceed. If your site has been running already, upload the database as well.\nAfter confirming file placement, open your domain in a browser. If DNS is not updated, you can:\nEdit the hosts file to simulate DNS changes. Use online tools to check DNS status. Install browser plugins for virtual hosts. If you need to move a site from a subfolder into public_html, use File Manager or FTP. Remember to upload the database if needed.\nStep 3: Upload the database to hosting Perform this step only if your website uses a database.\nCreate a database in cPanel Create a new database in MySQL Databases and record:\nMySQL Database MySQL User MySQL Host MySQL Password Create a new database\nOpen phpMyAdmin In phpMyAdmin, import your MySQL database. If importing into an existing database, clear it first to avoid errors.\nOpen phpMyAdmin\nImport the database Go to the Import tab and upload your SQL file (.sql, .sql.zip, or .sql.gz). Click Choose File, then Go to start. When phpMyAdmin shows Import has been successfully finished, 302 queries executed, the upload is done.\nImport database\nUpdate configuration for database connection After upload, open your PHP configuration file and fill in host, database name, username, and password. The file name and location depend on your software. For WordPress, the file is wp-config.php in public_html.\n⚠ Notes:\nLarge databases should be split into smaller files to speed up uploads. If your database contains special characters, convert them to ASCII before upload. If import errors occur, check for corruption. Create a fresh database and try again. After uploading, test your website to ensure everything works. Update configuration for database connection After uploading, open the PHP config file to enter the host, database name, username, and password.\nThe file name and location depend on your software. For example, WordPress uses wp-config.php in public_html.\nStep 4: Check if the website is stable To ensure stability after upload and domain mapping, perform the following checks:\n🔍 Check website access Access via domain or IP: If it loads, the site is live. Wait for DNS propagation: New DNS changes can take 24 hours. Check immediately using: 🖥️ Hosts file: Edit the hosts file to simulate DNS changes. 🌐 Online tools: Use online DNS checkers. 🔌 Browser plugins: Use plugins for virtual hosts. 🛠️ Test website functions Visit multiple pages and verify links. Ensure features work as expected. ⚡ Check load speed Use Google PageSpeed Insights or GTmetrix. 🚨 Check for errors 404: Page not found. 500: Hosting server error. 503: Server maintenance. 🌍 Test across browsers and devices Try Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge on desktop, mobile, tablet. ⏳ Test at different times Performance can vary throughout the day. 👉 If issues appear and you are unsure how to fix them, contact your hosting provider. 🚀\n📌 Conclusion Uploading a website to hosting is a key step for stable online operation.

Helps you work quickly with the system. Optimized for server management and small task automation. 🔹 Practical applications: Write automated server update scripts. Create periodic cron jobs. Manage users and permissions on Linux. 📝 Example: Automated server update script 1 2 #!/bin/bash sudo apt update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo apt upgrade -y 🚀 Go (Golang) (If working with Kubernetes) 🔹 Reasons to choose Go: High performance, easy to compile into compact binaries. Kubernetes and many DevOps tools like Terraform are written in Go. 🔹 Practical applications: Write container management tools. Create plugins for Kubernetes. Build custom DevOps tools. 📝 Example: Display system information with Go 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 package main import ( \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; \u0026#34;os\u0026#34; ) func main() { hostname, _ := os.Hostname() fmt.Println(\u0026#34;Hostname:\u0026#34;, hostname) } ⚙️ Groovy (If working with Jenkins) 🔹 Reasons to choose Groovy: The main language for writing pipelines in Jenkins. Flexible syntax, easy to extend and integrate with Java. 🔹 Practical applications: Write CI/CD pipelines for Jenkins. Create system management scripts. Automate build, test, deploy steps. 📝 Example: Basic pipeline in Jenkinsfile 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 pipeline { agent any stages { stage(\u0026#39;Build\u0026#39;) { steps { echo \u0026#39;Building the project...\u0026#39; sh \u0026#39;mvn clean package\u0026#39; } } stage(\u0026#39;Test\u0026#39;) { steps { echo \u0026#39;Running tests...\u0026#39; sh \u0026#39;mvn test\u0026#39; } } stage(\u0026#39;Deploy\u0026#39;) { steps { echo \u0026#39;Deploying application...\u0026#39; sh \u0026#39;./deploy.sh\u0026#39; } } } } 🎯 Conclusion ✅ Python + Bash is the best choice to start with DevOps. ✅ If working with Kubernetes, learn Go as well. ✅ If working with Jenkins, learn Groovy to write pipelines. 👉 Next step: Learn the basics of Linux \u0026amp; operating systems.\n","date":"2025-02-21T00:00:00Z","image":"https://tech.nguuyen.io.vn/images/devops/devops-step-one.webp","permalink":"https://tech.nguuyen.io.vn/en/posts/devops/devops-step-one/","title":"Choosing a Programming Language 🤗"},{"content":"Understanding DevOps DevOps is the combination of software development and system operations, aimed at enhancing collaboration and automation in the software development and deployment process.\nLearn a Programming Language Mastering at least one programming language is essential for effective automation and system management.\nPopular Languages\nPython Go Ruby Master Operating System Knowledge Linux: Popular operating system in server environments.
