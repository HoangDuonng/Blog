Choosing the right language helps you work more efficiently with systems, automate many processes, and improve software development speed.\n🔥 Suitable languages for DevOps 🐍 Python (Main recommendation) 🔹 Reasons to choose Python: Easy-to-read syntax, easy to learn. Rich libraries supporting automation like fabric, paramiko, boto3 (AWS SDK), pyinfra. Strong support in Cloud management (AWS, GCP, Azure). 🔹 Practical applications: Write automated code deployment scripts. Create server management bots. Build system management APIs. 📝 Example: Automated SSH deployment script with Paramiko 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 import paramiko def deploy_code(host, user, password, command): client = paramiko.SSHClient() client.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy()) client.connect(hostname=host, username=user, password=password) stdin, stdout, stderr = client.exec_command(command) print(stdout.read().decode()) client.close() deploy_code(\u0026#39;192.168.1.100\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;ubuntu\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;yourpassword\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;git pull origin main \u0026amp;\u0026amp; systemctl restart app\u0026#39;) 🖥️ Bash (Need to know basics) 🔹 Reasons to choose Bash: The most popular shell script on Linux. Helps you work quickly with the system. Optimized for server management and small task automation. 🔹 Practical applications: Write automated server update scripts. Create periodic cron jobs. Manage users and permissions on Linux. 📝 Example: Automated server update script 1 2 #!/bin/bash sudo apt update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo apt upgrade -y 🚀 Go (Golang) (If working with Kubernetes) 🔹 Reasons to choose Go: High performance, easy to compile into compact binaries. Kubernetes and many DevOps tools like Terraform are written in Go. 🔹 Practical applications: Write container management tools. Create plugins for Kubernetes. Build custom DevOps tools. 📝 Example: Display system information with Go 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 package main import ( \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; \u0026#34;os\u0026#34; ) func main() { hostname, _ := os.Hostname() fmt.Println(\u0026#34;Hostname:\u0026#34;, hostname) } ⚙️ Groovy (If working with Jenkins) 🔹 Reasons to choose Groovy: The main language for writing pipelines in Jenkins. Flexible syntax, easy to extend and integrate with Java. 🔹 Practical applications: Write CI/CD pipelines for Jenkins. Create system management scripts. Automate build, test, deploy steps. 📝 Example: Basic pipeline in Jenkinsfile 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 pipeline { agent any stages { stage(\u0026#39;Build\u0026#39;) { steps { echo \u0026#39;Building the project...\u0026#39; sh \u0026#39;mvn clean package\u0026#39; } } stage(\u0026#39;Test\u0026#39;) { steps { echo \u0026#39;Running tests...\u0026#39; sh \u0026#39;mvn test\u0026#39; } } stage(\u0026#39;Deploy\u0026#39;) { steps { echo \u0026#39;Deploying application...\u0026#39; sh \u0026#39;./deploy.sh\u0026#39; } } } } 🎯 Conclusion ✅ Python + Bash is the best choice to start with DevOps. ✅ If working with Kubernetes, learn Go as well. ✅ If working with Jenkins, learn Groovy to write pipelines. 👉 Next step: Learn the basics of Linux \u0026amp; operating systems.\n","date":"2025-02-21T00:00:00Z","image":"https://tech.nguuyen.io.vn/images/devops/devops-step-one.webp","permalink":"https://tech.nguuyen.io.vn/en/posts/devops/devops-step-one/","title":"Choosing a Programming Language 🤗"},{"content":"Understanding DevOps DevOps is the combination of software development and system operations, aimed at enhancing collaboration and automation in the software development and deployment process.\nLearn a Programming Language Mastering at least one programming language is essential for effective automation and system management.\nPopular Languages\nPython Go Ruby Master Operating System Knowledge Linux: Popular operating system in server environments.
